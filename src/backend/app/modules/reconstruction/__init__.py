"""Module 5 — Reconstruction: where the vehicles were, top-down, in metres.

Two outputs:
* build_reconstruction: the top-down map. From measured positions (sensor / GPS paths) when there are
  any; otherwise from camera tracks of a calibrated view projected onto the road plane; otherwise empty
  with a note saying what evidence is missing. Nothing is drawn without positional evidence.
* build_event_analysis: the camera footage with its detections and image-space tracks (pixels). That is
  evidence playback, not a reconstruction, and the dashboard shows it as "Event Analysis".
